# EcoliSTL


## Introduction
 [*Escherichia coli*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli), as a significant tool for Molecular Biology, has similar position in scientific study with STL in C++. Here I present EcSTL, a simple version of C++ STL inspired in reading ["The Annotated STL Sources"](http://www.amazon.cn/STL%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E5%89%96%E6%9E%90-%E4%BE%AF%E6%8D%B7/dp/B00116JFS0). I started this project just for practice and it is not practical. 

 

## Enviroment
 Windows 8.1 + Visual Studio 2013
